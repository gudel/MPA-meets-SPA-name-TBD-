# One page MPA meets SPA hybrid (name pending)

A small project meant to push my ability to create, design, and implement multiple styles and methods of implementation. 

Utilises Next.js app template, refactored into specs 

## Purpose

This project aims to refine my **ideation → refinement → code prototyping → implementation → debugging** workflow and compress it into the shortest timeframe possible.

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

## Debug log

The product page will be modified to be a pseudo dev log.

## Credits (Will be moved to a dedicated page later)
Scanline effect - The overlay is inspired and some code borrowed and iterated upon from Edwin at [dev.to.io](https://dev.to/ekeijl/retro-crt-terminal-screen-in-css-js-4afh) and related articles. Here is his [git](https://github.com/custom-start-page/retro-crt).
