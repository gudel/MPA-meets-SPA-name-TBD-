Scanline Thickness Issue
1. Initial Issue

Symptoms: 1px thickness didn't render as expected.

Observed Behavior: The effect was inconsistent across multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Firefox).

Cause: Potential changes in how thin background layers are rendered by browser engines like Blink and Gecko.

2. Testing Results

1px: Only works if it's slightly above (tested at 1.1px), indicating a limitation in rendering ultra-thin elements.

4px: Confirmed to consistently deliver the intended visual effect.

3. Workarounds

mix-blend-mode: overlay and background-size adjustments: No effect on rendering behavior.

Box-shadow, mask-image, and translateZ(0): Confirmed to have no impact.

Conclusion: 4px is the confirmed stable configuration for the desired result.

4. Solution

Final Solution: Implemented a 4px thickness to achieve the consistent and expected visual effect.
